# Volunteer Hour Tracker DApp

## Overview

The **Volunteer Hour Tracker** is a decentralized application (DApp) built on Ethereum that allows volunteers to log their volunteer hours and earn tokens as a reward for their contributions. The tokens are ERC-20-like tokens managed by the smart contract itself. Volunteers can claim their earned tokens after logging their hours.

This DApp uses **MetaMask** for wallet management and **Web3.js** for blockchain interaction.

---

## Features

- **Log Volunteer Hours**: Volunteers can log the number of hours they have worked, and in return, they earn tokens.
- **Claim Tokens**: Volunteers can claim the tokens they've earned based on the hours worked.
- **Display Token Balance**: The DApp shows the current token balance of the connected user.
- **Ethereum Smart Contract**: The application interacts with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to handle logging hours, awarding tokens, and claiming tokens.

---

## Technologies

- **Solidity**: For writing the smart contract that tracks volunteer hours and rewards tokens.
- **Web3.js**: To interact with the Ethereum blockchain from the frontend.
- **MetaMask**: A browser extension to manage Ethereum accounts and transactions.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the frontend user interface.

---

## Prerequisites

Before using this DApp, make sure you have the following:

- **MetaMask**: A browser extension to manage Ethereum accounts. [Download MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).
- **Ether**: Make sure your MetaMask wallet is funded with some Ether for interacting with the Ethereum network.
- **Web Browser**: A modern browser like Google Chrome or Firefox with MetaMask installed.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Deploy the Smart Contract

1. Deploy the `VolunteerHourTracker` smart contract to the Ethereum network (e.g., Rinkeby testnet or mainnet).
   - You can use [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or a framework like [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) to deploy the contract.
2. After deployment, note down the **contract address** as you will need it in the frontend setup.

### 2. Setup Frontend

1. Clone or download the repository containing the `index.html` file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Replace the placeholder `YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in the JavaScript section with the contract address from the deployment step.

```javascript
const contractAddress = "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"; // Replace with your contract's deployed address
```

### 3. Using the DApp

1. **Open the Frontend**: Open the `index.html` file in your browser (you can also serve it via a local web server like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for easier development).
2. **Connect MetaMask**: Click the "Connect MetaMask" button to link your MetaMask wallet with the DApp.
3. **Log Volunteer Hours**: Enter the number of hours you’ve volunteered and click "Log Hours". This will log the hours and award tokens.
4. **Claim Tokens**: Click "Claim Tokens" to claim the tokens you’ve earned.
5. **Check Token Balance**: The DApp will display the current balance of tokens earned and available for claiming.

## How It Works

### Smart Contract Functions

- **logVolunteerHours**: This function is called when a volunteer logs their hours. It takes the number of hours worked as an argument and calculates the tokens earned.
- **claimTokens**: Volunteers can call this function to claim their earned tokens. After claiming, their token balance is reset.
- **volunteerTokens**: This function returns the current token balance of the calling address.

### Token System

- Tokens are awarded at a rate of 1 token per hour (1 \* 10^18 wei per hour). Volunteers can earn tokens for the hours they log.
- Tokens are not transferable in this basic implementation; they are managed within the contract.
- Volunteers can claim the tokens they have earned, and after claiming, their token balance will be reset to 0.

---

## Example Use Case

1. **Volunteer 1** logs 5 hours of volunteer work.
2. The smart contract awards 5 tokens (1 token per hour).
3. **Volunteer 1** can claim the 5 tokens after the hours are logged.
4. **Volunteer 1** withdraws the tokens to their MetaMask wallet.

---

## Contract Code

The smart contract used in this DApp is written in Solidity and can be found in the `VolunteerHourTracker.sol` file. It includes the following key functions:

- `logVolunteerHours(uint256 hoursWorked)`: Logs hours worked and awards tokens.
- `claimTokens()`: Allows the volunteer to claim their earned tokens.
- `volunteerTokens()`: Returns the token balance for a specific address.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Token Transfers**: Implement ERC-20 functionality so tokens can be transferred between users.
- **Integration with a Token Marketplace**: Enable volunteers to trade or sell their earned tokens.
- **Reward Levels**: Introduce levels of rewards based on the number of hours volunteered.
- **Social Features**: Allow volunteers to create profiles and display their total hours worked.
